		<hr/><h2>We're improving an analyzer's communication capability.</h2>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.orthoclinical.com/en-us/home" target="_blank">Ortho Clinical Diagnostics</a> is a leading provider in vitro diagnostics, serving the global clinical laboratory and immunohematology communities. 
Across hospital networks, blood banks, and labs in more than 120 countries, Ortho’s high-quality products and services enable healthcare professionals to make better-informed treatment decisions. 
For the immunohematology community, Ortho’s blood typing products help ensure every patient receives blood that is safe in every way. 
Ortho brings sophisticated testing technologies, automation, information management, and interpretation tools to clinical laboratories around the world to help them run more efficiently, effectively and improve patient care. 
Ortho’s next generation of chemistry analyzers run physician-ordered tests on patient fluid samples to provide diagnostics results critical to patient care. 
A hospital’s Laboratory Information System(LIS) sends test orders to these connected analyzers, and receives completed results in return. 
New standards for interoperability require the implementation and testing of new analyzer software interfaces and test tools.
<br/>
This project extends the ability of an existing analyzer to communicate with laboratory information systems using those new industry communication standards and technologies.
By doing so we will enable the analyzers to be more readily integrated into hospitals and laboratories around the world where they will contribute to positive health outcomes.
